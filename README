**Periodic Boundary Conditions Automation in Abaqus**

**Overview**  
This script automates the application of periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) to a cubic model in Abaqus. It is designed to simplify the setup of boundary conditions for simulations involving representative volume elements (RVEs) or homogenization studies.

**Features**  
- Automatically detects cube geometry and mesh.  
- Applies periodic boundary conditions to opposing faces of the cube.  
- Handles displacement and rotational degrees of freedom.  
- Configurable for cubes of different dimensions.  
- Generates a summary of applied constraints.

**Usage Instructions**  
1. Open Abaqus/CAE and ensure your model is loaded.  
2. Place this script in the working directory.  
3. Execute the script using the Abaqus Python interpreter:
   ```
   abaqus python <script_name>.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to input the required details about your model.  

**Requirements**  
- Abaqus/CAE with Python scripting support.  
- A cubic model with a properly defined mesh.  

**Limitations**  
- The script assumes a structured cube mesh.  
- Only supports cubic geometries (no arbitrary shapes).  

**Notes**  
- Review the applied constraints after running the script to confirm accuracy.  
- Ensure the modelâ€™s geometry and mesh follow standard conventions for periodic boundary conditions.
